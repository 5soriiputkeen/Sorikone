# Sorikone
This is the first release of Sorikone. Working functionalities include making draws, checking head-to-head record, viewing seasonal and all-time win-rate.

I have done this app as a part of my studies at the University of Helsinki. This is my first desktop app, so don't expect perfection. Please report any bugs or things to improve to otto.suokas@helsinki.fi

## Downloading
Windows
- The downloadable zip-file has the folder "Sorikone" which the executable Sorikone.exe lies in.
- When moving the app around in your computer files, move the entire Sorikone folder.

Mac
- When running the Sorikone.app for the first time, MacOS will claim the app is "damaged". This is a standard MacOS security feature.
- To remove the damaged flag from the app, run xattr -cr /path/to/Sorikone.app in your terminal. You can do this by first typing xattr -cr and then dragging the app from finder to the terminal and pressing enter. If xattr doesn't work, replace it with /usr/bin/xattr.
